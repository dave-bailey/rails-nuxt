Incorporating the AZT into the kickoff of our summer plans was an obvious choice. The trail guided us through captivating landscapes and an amazing array of plant life.<br><br>From the exhilarating highs of a one-day rim-to-rim hike in the Grand Canyon to the challenging lows of grappling with ankle tendonitis and enduring less-than-appetizing water sources, the trail presented the full spectrum of experiences.<br><br>Our journey was enriched by the company of fantastic fellow hikers, creating a true adventure that left an indelible mark.

Instead of a planned southbound hike of the Laugavegur and Fimmvörðuháls trails, we pivoted to starting in Þórsmörk, heading north to Landmannalaugar, and eventually making our way back south to Skogar. Initially dropped off in the midst of a storm, our motivation to tackle the Icelandic wilderness was far from apparent. Yet, as the sun emerged, so did the breathtaking scenery — neon green landscapes, volcanic black expanses, and blue glaciers that filled me with joy and stole my heart. From steam vents and hot springs to multicolored mountains, wild glaciers, volcanoes, and endless waterfalls, this relatively short trail packed a punch.<br><br>The experience was nothing short of magical, and I'm immensely grateful that we could embark on this unforgettable trek.",

The Appalachian Trail intersected with many of these summits, yet during my AT journey, I hesitated to expend precious energy on bagging peaks that, at the time, didn't seem particularly valuable. Nevertheless, the Whites stand out as the jewels of the East Coast, and more often than not, I find joy in having prioritized standing atop their tallest peaks.<br><br>Admittedly, these mountains are undeniably tough, some seemingly for no reason at all. However, I relish the excuse for a challenge, savor the time spent with my wife, and revel in discovering new wonders right outside our doorstep.",

What captivates me about peak bagging is its ability to whisk you away to the less-prioritized corners of the mountains, introducing new adventures that might have otherwise slipped under the radar. The Southeast has been my home for the majority of my life, and this pursuit has granted me an intimate knowledge and connection to the Southern Appalachian mountains.<br><br>It was amidst the summits of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park that we unexpectedly encountered the NOBO bubble on the Appalachian Trail, sparking a 'dare-we-speak-it' desire of attempting a thru-hike of the AT. This collection of mountains not only fulfilled a personal challenge but also positioned me to be inspired to pursue an audacious and seemingly impossible dream."

This passion evolved into a love for thru-hiking, leading me down a path of adventure that once seemed beyond my wildest dreams. While the 14ers were initially a focal point and project throughout my college years, their significance shifted when I grasped the profound possibilities of thru-hiking.<br><br>Now, with only ten peaks left on the list of 58, I hold onto the dream of completing it someday. I envision returning to Colorado, my cherished home away from home, to conquer the mountains and finish what I started so many years ago.",
